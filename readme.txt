INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Install Node in your local machine

Create a sub-folder in the location where Node is installed

In this sub-folder, clone the contents of the git repo

Once the repo is cloned, from the command line run the following command:
npm install
This will install the latest versions of all the node modules on your local machine

Start the server using:
node index.js

Now, install PostgreSQL in your local machine

Once you have ensured that the POSTGRESQL server instance is running, you will have to manually create a database
and the requisite tables. Post that the system should be ready for use.

The functionality of the REST API can be checked using POSTMAN.
